# Sample workflow for building and deploying a Jekyll site to GitHub Pages
# Modified to push built site to gh-pages branch for Vercel deployment
name: Deploy Jekyll site to gh-pages branch

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: ["main"]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions to allow pushing to gh-pages branch
permissions:
  contents: write  # Changed from original: need write access to push branch

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
